# Project 1: Roo Bix Cu(b)e aka Tic Tac Toe/Crosses And Noughts
***

This project was coded in JavaScript, HTML and CSS with the help from DT, Kasun, YouTube vids, Google and fullslack team.

## Approach

During the thought process, I tried to break the game up into different parts to make
it easier for me to understand what I need to do to achieve the overall outcome.

I found each part is challenging and need to overcome lots of obstacles to achieve the result.

I referred back to some of the previous code alongs exercises that we done in class in order to assist me with some of the problems.

## What I learned

I found that there is no easy way of learning JavaScript apart from practice, practice and lots of practice. Lots of frustrating nights looking and figuring out why my code isn't working the first time round. There are also lots of syntax to learn. A single semicolon, a misplaced curly bracket or even an equal sign missing could make the code not work for you. I learned not to read up on too much of other tic tac toe games examples online but to try use my own approach even though if it failed me lots of times.

I struggled with the logic of it at times and I need to brush up on the basics. It's already hard to enough to learn JavaScript but to integrate it with CSS and HTML is very challenging. I learned to be determined and not to give up easily.

## Unsolved problems

I tried to make the reset button but it is not reloading the page. When a player wins, it won't reset the game and player was able to keep clicking on another box. It kept toggling between player 1 and player 2 with each click even when a box space has been occupied by the previous player.

## To Do List

 * Write better and cleaner code
 * Fix bug for after a player wins, game should reset itself
 * Fix reset button
 * Fix bug to recognise which player's turn to move without based on the sequence of clicks.

## Future features

  * Input background sounds
  * Intro for the game
  * Make the game more engaging for the player by asking player name input
  * Background image for each box
  * Score chart for player winnings
  * Timer for player movement input
